		"descr":"Detecting the undetectable will be an Introduction to experimental high energy physics. How do we test and validate the theories? Experimental High energy physics is a way to study the nature and behaviour of the elementary particles of the universe and an attempt to solve some of the unsolved mysteries of the universe.<br>Piercing the Invisible cosmos will cover up Radio astronomy  With radio astronomy, we study astronomical phenomena that are often invisible or hidden in other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. From detecting the black hole image to predicting the gravitational wave events, radio astronomy is key behind such groundbreaking discoveries.",

The first example is probably Newton's gravitational law which says that the equation used for describing the force that a planet exerts on another planet is the same for for that on an apple. Then came up unified fields like the Quantumelectrodynamics ... and so on and so forth. So gear up for the talk by Tiyasa Kar on 17 October 2019 where you will be taken for a ride to 'Theory of Everything'.",
